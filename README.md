# MEA 0183 Bandwidth Calculator (Tkinter Project Version)
This is the next iteration of the NMEA 0183 Bandwidth Calculator that adds a database editor

This project is a continuation of the legcay program and tries to organize a project better and adds additional funcitonality.

## Features

- Show detailed sentence information
- Calculate bandwidth usage for multiple sentences
- Support for different baud rates (4800, 38400)
- Support for various update rates (0.5Hz to 20Hz)
- Database Editor
- Database Backup
- User Interface Enhancements (font, font size, bold font toggle, text color, background color user controls)


*** NOTES ***

While I did attempt to create a fairly full and robust list of NMEA 0183 sentences in the json file, it is by no means a complete list of all that is out there.
The NMEA 0183 specifcaiton goes back to 1983 (inception, 1987 first official standard). There have been approx 8 updates since. 
The cost of purchasing the spec docs is astronomical so i did my best from what I could get off the Internet.
Having said that, the sentence details are accurate with the exception of the standards details. I had great ambition when starting but it was too labor intensive for me.
However, the inclusion of a database editor and backup feature makes it easy to grow the sentence data, including proprietary sentence data.
